1. What should the calculator look like and function?
1.1 Calculating SoH of a battery
1.2 At a specific point in time 
1.3 User Interface with 
1.3.1 Page Descrptions (This should show SoH, SoC, Battery types(Chemicals), Battery function(Stationary or Mobile))
1.3.2 Battery Descrptions Write or Read function
1.4 Input Data 
1.4.1 Select Battery type from dropdown 
1.4.2 Input battery Norminal Capacity
//1.4.3 Calculate battery Actual Capacity 
//1.4.3.1 State




1. Learn Java map, hashmap, list , set
2. Write manually only one discharge period powers with their times in a "map",or seperately in "lists"
3. second step for charge energy
3. calculate the battery energy in kWh
4. divide the calculated energy to nominal voltage(650V)==> you get actual battery capacity in (Ah)
5. calculate SoH via using the nominal capacity(82kWh)
6. print out
